Signal Peptides
----------------
A signal peptide is a short amino acid sequence that is
present at the N-terminus (beginning) of a protein. Its
function is to direct the protein to its proper location
within a cell or to be secreted outside of the cell.

Structure
~~~~~~~~~
Signal peptides typically consist of 15-30 amino acids
and have a specific amino acid sequence and structure.
They are often rich in hydrophobic (water-repelling)
amino acids, which allows them to interact with the 
lipid bilayer of the cell membrane during protein transport.

Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several methods for identifying signal peptides
in proteins, including manual inspection of the amino acid
sequence, use of prediction algorithms, and experimental
techniques such as hydropathy plots and cleavage site mapping.
One widely used prediction algorithm is called signalP, which
uses artificial neural networks to identify signal peptides
based on their amino acid sequence and other features.

Goal
~~~~
The goal of engineering signal peptides is to improve their
function and efficiency through the use of simulation and
machine learning techniques. By simulating the behavior of
different signal peptides and analyzing the results, it is
possible to identify changes that can be made to improve their
performance. Machine learning algorithms can then be used to
automatically identify patterns and predict the most effective
changes to make.

Importance
~~~~~~~~~~
Correct targeting and localization of proteins within a cell is
crucial for their proper function. Signal peptides play a key
role in this process, and defects in signal peptides can lead to
mislocalization or improper folding of proteins, which can have
serious consequences for the cell and the organism.
