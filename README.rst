Signal Peptides
----------------
A signal peptide is a short amino acid sequence(15-30 amino acids) 
that is (typically)present at the N-terminus (beginning) of a protein. 
Its function is to direct the protein to its proper location
within a cell or to be secreted outside of the cell.

Identification
--------------
One widely used prediction algorithm is called signalP, which
uses artificial neural networks to identify signal peptides
based on their amino acid sequence and other features.
Which will also be used in this work. 

Goal
----
The goal of engineering signal peptides for secretion of proteins 
in Aspergillus oryzae through the use of simulation and
machine learning techniques.
