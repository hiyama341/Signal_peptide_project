This can be accomplished through a variety of computational methods, such as bioinformatics, machine learning, and statistical analysis.\n","\n","One common approach is to use bioinformatics methods to analyze large sets of data on known signal peptides and identify patterns or features that are associated with signal peptide function. These features can then be used to predict the function of novel sequences.\n","\n","Machine learning algorithms can also be used to predict signal peptides. These algorithms can be trained on large sets of data on known signal peptides, and can then be used to predict the function of novel sequences. Common machine learning algorithms used for this purpose include decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.\n","\n","Another approach is to use statistical analysis to identify the regions of the peptide sequences that are most likely to function as signal peptides. This can be done by analyzing the frequency and distribution of different amino acids in known signal peptides and identifying those that are over-represented or under-represented in these sequences.\n","\n","In summary, by developing an algorithm, we can narrow down the search space and identify the sequences that are most likely to function as signal peptides, thus avoiding combinatorial explosion. The algorithm we are showcasing here is based on a combination of bioinformatics, machine learning and statistical analysis.\n","\n","### Agenda:\n","- Use AutoML predictions and synthetic signal
